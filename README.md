## Known issues

Expo SDK and libreries are always updating their versions. Before installing the libreries run.

```
yarn add expo@latest
```

Next you can run:

```
npx expo install
```

Expo will show you what dependencies need to be updated. Install the dependencies expo suggested you. It is possible that there is cache and you have to run.

```
yarn start --reset-cache
```
